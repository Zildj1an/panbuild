# Panbuild

Panbuild is a _make-like_ builder for [pandoc][pandoc]. It is a command-line tool that aims to simplify the construction of multiple output files (in different formats) from a given input (source) document. 


Panbuild relies on YAML code (e.g., included in a separate _build_ file) to specify the various options that must be passed to [pandoc][pandoc] for the different output formats. This removes the need for repeatedly typing possibly long and complex pandoc commands for each and every target output format. At the same time, this tool greatly simplifies the integration of Pandoc with extensible text editors, such as Sublime Text, and, more importantly, it prevents the user from interacting with pandoc directly via the command line.
