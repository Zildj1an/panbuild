# pandoc-numbering

*panbuild* is a wrapper around [pandoc] that aims to simplify the construction of multiple output files (in different formats) from a given input (source) document. The tool allows the user to specify the build options for the various output formats using YAML (e.g., included in a separate build file), thus removing the need of repeatedly typing potentially long and complex [pandoc] commands for each and every output format supported.
